         We all know already that teamwork is the key to success in most realms of life and business. 
         Only through teamwork can we combine different, 
         complementary points of view to identify and seize hidden synergy opportunities, 
         overcome difficult obstacles and achieve challenging objectives.

                However, teamwork is a challenge in and of itself.
                It requires that people manage their egos, develop humility, communicate effectively, 
                resolve conflicts and, above all, commit to one another and to a common goal. 
                Anyone who has worked on a team knows that the only way to do so successfully is by 
                assessing oneself honestly and becoming the best person one can be. In this regard, 
                not only does teamwork increase performance, it also promotes the development of better citizens and societies.

                A working group is nothing more than a collection of individuals who make independent contributions to a common objective, 
                thus requiring low levels of integration and alignment. 
                Working groups function well in certain contexts where complexity is low and the objectives are straightforward.
                 However, they become less and less effective as the environment becomes more complex and the objectives become more challenging. 
                 More specifically, when identifying and seizing synergies become a prerequisite for survival and long-term sustainability, 
                 working groups must evolve into teams or else they will drift away into oblivion
